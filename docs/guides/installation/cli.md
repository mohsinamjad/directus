# Installing from CLI

## 1. Confirm Minimum Requirements

Directus requires two things to run: [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev) and a Database. For both these system requirements,
we aim to support the current LTS release (and newer). At the time of writing (early 2021), this means Node.js v10+ and
one of the following:

| Database      | Version |
| ------------- | ------- |
| PostgreSQL    | 10+     |
| MySQL         | 5.7.8+  |
| SQLite        | 3+      |
| MS-SQL Server | 13.0+   |
| OracleDB      | 19+     |
| MariaDB       | 10.2+   |

::: tip Variants

In addition to the databases above, other variants are also supported, including **AWS Aurora** (MySQL), **AWS
Redshift** (PostgreSQL), and **MariaDB**.

## 2. Create a Project

Navigate to the directory where you wish to create a new Directus project. The new project and directory will be created
inside the current directory. Create a new Directus project by running the following npm command.

```bash
npx create-directus-project my-project
```

::: warning

Except for SQLite, the database must already be running before creating your Directus project.

:::

## 3. Start your Project

To start Directus, navigate to the project directory, _my-project_.

```bash
cd my-project
```

Run the following command in your project directory.

```bash
npx directus start
```

## 4. View your Project

The default port used by Directus is 8055. To view your project locally, go to
[http://localhost:8055](http://localhost:8055) in your browser.

::: tip Changing Port

If you want to use a different port, use [the `PORT` environment variable](/reference/environment-variables/#general).
